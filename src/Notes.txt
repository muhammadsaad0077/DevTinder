Tilde (~) notation in package.json
      The tilde (~) notation is employed to match the latest patch version while freezing the major and minor versions.
      This notation is useful for automatically accepting bug fixes, considering that patch updates primarily address bugs.


Caret (^) notation in package.json
      It automatically updates both minor and patch updates.

      Example: The ^1.2.4 will update all the future Minor and patch updates, for example, ^1.2.4 will automatically change
      the dependency to 1.x.x if any update occurs. 
      Using caret notation it is important to look at our code regularly if it is compatible with the newest version or not.
